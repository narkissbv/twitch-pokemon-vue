# twitch-pokemon-vue
A Twitch panel extension implementation using Vue3, Vuex, composition API

# Build instructions
Simply clone the repo, and run
```
npm run build
```
to build a production-ready minified HTML, JS, CSS (will be available under `/dist`)
or run
```
npm run serve
```
to run a node server locally (since you'll need to use Twitch's auth method, this step might be tricky to simulate locally).
